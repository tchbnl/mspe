# Help message
show_help() {
    echo -e "${TEXT_BOLD}mspe${TEXT_RESET} is an MSP-like tool for Postfix servers.

USAGE: mspe [--rotated|--rbl]
    --rotated                   Check rotated maillog files as well when fetching stats
    --rbl                       Check server IPs against common RBLs (no stats check)
    -h --help                   Show this message and exit
    -v --version                Show version information and exit

Without arguments (except --rotated) mspe fetches mail server stats from the current maillog (like msp.pl --auth)."
