**mspe** is an [MSP](https://github.com/CpanelInc/tech-MSP)-like tool for Postfix servers.

Checking IPs in RBLs...

        üëç b.barracudacentral.org
        üëç bl.spamcop.net
        üëç dnsbl.sorbs.net
        üëç zen.spamhaus.org
```

It recreates the most useful (IMO) features from MSP, like showing the full mail server stats and checking server IPs against RBLs. In the future I might add support to output important config values also.

## Email Subjects in the Postfix maillog

Postifx doesn't record the email subject by default in its log. You'll need to add an include in the config for this.

1. Uncomment or add this to the Postfix `main.cf` file:
```
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
```

2. Add this to the file:
```
/^Subject:/ WARN
```

3. And then save and reload Postfix. All new emails in the log will record the subject line now.

Unfortunately Postfix doesn't have a way (that I know of) to record the directory an email was sent out of (like Exim's `cwd`).
